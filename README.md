## Key Datasets for Job Quality Index

- monthly jobs data by industry from EDA which we will be using. 
- annual census public use microdata which we will be using. Note IPUMs is a public service which makes the fairly messy census data a bit easier to work with. Try to get a dataset together and download since that's a process in and of itself. See the end of this email for some of the IPUMs fields we typically use though feel free to poke around the site and flag anything that looks relevant. 
- translation spreadsheet with the various ways California slices up its regions which we will use to aggregate and analyze the quality jobs metrics. Note there will be an additional column for the regions used in the Community Economic Resiliency Fund (CERF) which will come out soon.

use the IPUMs data to estimate the probability an industry sector is a quality job. (note we might just end up calling these high wage jobs though that's a coms question down the road)

 high wage is defined as meeting the:
 
1. state mean wage
2. regional mean wage
3. housing cost adjusted of state mean wage
4. housing cost adjusted regional mean wage
5. a multiple of the real cost measure (which the United Way folks dissuaded me from)
